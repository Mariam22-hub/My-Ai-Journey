# My-Ai-Journey
In this respository, i'll be documenting my journey to learning Ai. 
Starting from Data Analysis to Deep Learning, i'll be posting all the projects i've worked on and the topics i've learned throughout the weeks. 

*So whish me Luck :)) !*

I'll be studying from **Jose Portilla's Data science and Machine Learning 2022 course** on Udemy, as well as **Alexey Gregorev's ML zoomcamp**
As for a book reference, my choice is **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron**

I'll be adding more topics to the tables and updating this description as i go along

### Topics i'd learned before creating this journey repository
- Python Programming & OOP
- Software Engineering **Solid Principles** and **Design Patterns**
- [Web Scraping](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping)
  - [Top 250 Rated Movies Project](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Top%20250%20rated%20movies) uses **BeautifulSoup4** and **Requests** libraries to    scrape the IMDB website, to store the names, ranks, ratings, and release dates of all the **Top 250 rated movies**
  - [Real Estate Project] (https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Real%20Estate%20housing) uses **BeautifulSoup4** and **Requests** libraries to scrape the [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com/apartments/amsterdam) website. I used the csv library to store the names, locations, prices, and surface areas of each apartment in a csv file 
- Database Design
- Sql ( Hackerrank Badge )

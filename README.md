# My-Ai-Journey
In this respository, i'll be documenting my journey to learning Ai. 
Starting from Data Analysis to Deep Learning, i'll be posting all the projects i've worked on and the topics i've learned throughout the weeks. 

*So whish me Luck :)) !*

I'll be studying from Jose Portilla's Data science and Machine Learning 2022 course on udemy, as well as Alexey Gregorev's ML zoomcamp
As for a book reference, my choice is Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron

I'll be adding more topics to the tables and updating this description as i go along

# My-Ai-Journey
In this respository, i'll be documenting my journey to learning Ai. 
Starting from Data Analysis to Deep Learning, i'll be posting all the projects i've worked on and the topics i've learned throughout the upcoming weeks. 

*So whish me Luck :)) !*

I'll be studying from [**Jose Portilla's Data science and Machine Learning 2022 course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/) on Udemy, as well as [**Alexey Gregorev's ML zoomcamp**](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp).
As for a book reference, my choice is [**Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron**](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646)

I'll be adding more topics to the tables and updating this description as i go along

### Topics i'd learned before creating this repository:
- Python Programming & OOP
- Software Engineering **Solid Principles** and **Design Patterns**
- [Web Scraping](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping)
  - [Top 250 Rated Movies Project](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Top%20250%20rated%20movies) uses **BeautifulSoup4** and **Requests** libraries to    scrape the IMDB website, to store the names, ranks, ratings, and release dates of all the **Top 250 rated movies**
  - [Real Estate Project](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Real%20Estate%20housing) uses **BeautifulSoup4** and **Requests** libraries to scrape [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com/apartments/amsterdam) website. I used the **CSV** library to store the names, locations, prices, and surface areas of each apartment in a csv file 
- Database Design
- Sql ( [Hackerrank Badge](https://www.hackerrank.com/h11410120200528?badge=sql&stars=3&level=2&hr_r=1&utm_campaign=social-buttons&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=badge_share_profile&social=linkedin&fbclid=IwAR1PupmABngD-pVdOEsAD_b06MitIic9ccaM5voIZcx2zI_ORi9Zu1eVrYs) )

### Week 1:
1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Intro to Machine Learning

#### 1. Descriptive Statistics
For this week, i decided to revise some descriptive statistics since i was a little rusty. I went over the following topics:
- Measures of central Tendency ( Mean, Median, Mode, Weighted mean )
- Measures of dispersion ( Variance, Standard Deviation, Range, Interquartile ranges, coefficient of variation
- Central Limit Theorm

Udacity's [Introduction to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) is a great source for either revising or learning about descriptive statistics from scratch

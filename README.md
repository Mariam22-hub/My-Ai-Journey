# My-Ai-Journey
In this respository, i'll be documenting my journey to learning Ai. 
Starting from Data Analysis to Deep Learning, i'll be posting all the projects i've worked on and the topics i've learned throughout the upcoming weeks. 

*So whish me Luck :))*

I'll be studying from [**Andre Ng Machine Learning Specialization**](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/) for theoritcal learning, as well as [**Alexey Gregorev's ML zoomcamp**](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) for a more practical approach.
As for a book reference, my choice is [**Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller, Sarah Guido**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/)

I'll be adding more topics to the tables and updating this description as i go along

### Topics i'd learned before creating this repository:
- Python Programming & OOP
- Software Engineering **Solid Principles** and **Design Patterns**
- Object Oriented Design
- [Web Scraping](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping)
  - [Top 250 Rated Movies Project](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Top%20250%20rated%20movies) uses **BeautifulSoup4** and **Requests** libraries to    scrape the IMDB website, to store the names, ranks, ratings, and release dates of all the **Top 250 rated movies**
  - [Real Estate Project](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Real%20Estate%20housing) uses **BeautifulSoup4** and **Requests** libraries to scrape [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com/apartments/amsterdam) website. I used the **CSV** library to store the names, locations, prices, and surface areas of each apartment in a csv file 
- Database Design
- Sql ( [Hackerrank Badge](https://www.hackerrank.com/h11410120200528?badge=sql&stars=3&level=2&hr_r=1&utm_campaign=social-buttons&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=badge_share_profile&social=linkedin&fbclid=IwAR1PupmABngD-pVdOEsAD_b06MitIic9ccaM5voIZcx2zI_ORi9Zu1eVrYs) )

### - [Week 1](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Week1):
1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Numpy

#### 1. Descriptive Statistics
 For this week, i decided to revise some descriptive statistics since i was a little rusty. I went over the following topics:
- [Measures of central Tendency](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/blob/main/Week1/Measures%20of%20central%20tendency.md) ( Mean, Median, Mode, Weighted mean )
- [Measures of dispersion](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/blob/main/Week1/Measures%20of%20Dispersion.md) ( Variance, Standard Deviation, Range, Interquartile ranges, coefficient of variation )
- [Central Limit Theorm](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/blob/main/Week1/CLT.md)

Udacity's [Introduction to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) is a great source for either revising or learning descriptive statistics from scratch

#### 2. Numpy
I got my hands dirty on Numpy, which was actually my first time using it. I got introduced to how powerful and useful Numpy can be with all it's arrays and various functions. So, because i wanted to become familiarized with it's capabilities and build up my skills, i spent this week practising

For excercising, i found this extremely helpful [101 Numpy Excercises Website](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-numpy-exercises-python/).

### - [Week 2](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/tree/main/Week%202):
- Probability
- Pandas

#### 1. Probabilty
For this week, i revised on some of the topics in Probabilty
- [An intro to Probability](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/blob/main/Week%202/Into%20to%20Probabilty.md) (Types of Probability, Sample spaces, Bayes' Theorm)
- [Random Variables](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/blob/main/Week%202/Probability%20Distribution%20%26%20Random%20Variables.md) (Discrete and Continous random variables)
- [Discrete Probabilty Distribution](https://github.com/Mariam22-hub/My-Ai-Journey/blob/main/Week%202/Deicrete%20Probability%20Distribution.md) (Binomial, Bernoulli, Geometric,Hypergeometric, and Poisson distributions)

#### 2. Pandas
As my first time hitting Pandas, it took me the whole week learning and exercising. Fortunately, i got to learn all the basics and gained the nencessary knowledge for Machine Learning

For excercising, i found this extremely helpful [101 Pandas Exercises Website](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-pandas-exercises-python/).

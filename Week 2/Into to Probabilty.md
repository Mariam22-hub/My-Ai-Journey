####Introduction

#Probability is the likelihood or chance of an event occurring.

Probability =	 the number of ways of achieving success
 	 the total number of possible outcomes
For example, the probability of flipping a coin and it being heads is ½, because there is 1 way of getting a head and the total number of possible outcomes is 2 (a head or tail). We write P(heads) = ½ .

The probability of something which is certain to happen is 1.
The probability of something which is impossible to happen is 0.
The probability of something not happening is 1 minus the probability that it will happen.
